# SoundSaga

A little app in Flutter that allows you to discover music made exactly 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 or 60 years ago! When complete, it will use the Discogs API to get information about tracks on historic editions of the Billboard Hot 100, serving as a snapshot of an era.

## Current state

Currently, the app does not produce any output; the API connection is being worked on.
