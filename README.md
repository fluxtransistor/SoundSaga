# SoundSaga

A little app in Flutter that allows you to discover music made exactly 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 or 60 years ago! When complete, it will use a metadata API to get information about tracks on historic editions of the Billboard Hot 100, serving as a snapshot of an era.

## Current state

Currently, the app displays a 'stack' of dummy album covers and basic metadata. I plan to polish the UI on this page and link it to real Billboard data (which has been scraped already).

Finally, I will add a list view, links to music providers, and single/album information.
