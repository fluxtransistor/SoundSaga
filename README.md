# SoundSaga

A little app in Flutter that allows you to discover music made exactly 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 or 60 years ago! When complete, it will use the Discogs API to get information about tracks on historic editions of the Billboard Hot 100, serving as a snapshot of an era.

## Current state

Currently, the app does connects to the Discogs API on button press, fetches information on a track, and shows the album art and title.

This shows that the API connection works. However, the UI has yet to be added.
